Happy Number Finder

Simple Python program to find a required number of happy numbers.

A happy number is defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
